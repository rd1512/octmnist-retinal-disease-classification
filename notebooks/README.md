## Notebook: End-to-End Model Development

### OCTMNIST Classification.ipynb

This notebook contains the complete end-to-end deep learning pipeline for multi-class retinal disease classification using the OCTMNIST dataset (MedMNIST collection).

The workflow includes:

-  Dataset loading and preprocessing (normalization, splitting)
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (class distribution, pixel intensity analysis)
-  Custom CNN architecture built from scratch in PyTorch
-  Training loop implementation with validation monitoring
-  Performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall / F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
-  Model optimization techniques (e.g., regularization, learning rate tuning)
-  Model checkpointing and weight saving

The notebook demonstrates strong understanding of neural network training dynamics, evaluation metrics, and performance optimization strategies for medical image classification.
